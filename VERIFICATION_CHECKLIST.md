# ✅ Deployment Safety Verification Checklist

Complete this checklist to confirm all protections are in place.

---

## ✅ Code Changes

- [ ] `scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs` - Enhanced with safety checks
  ```bash
  grep -n "validateDeploymentConfig" scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs
  # Should find: function validateDeploymentConfig()
  ```

- [ ] `.husky/pre-commit` - Git hook prevents dangerous commits
  ```bash
  ls -la .husky/pre-commit
  # Should exist
  ```

- [ ] `scripts/validate-deploy.mjs` - Pre-deployment validator
  ```bash
  ls -la scripts/validate-deploy.mjs
  # Should exist
  ```

- [ ] `package.json` - Updated with `validate:deploy` script
  ```bash
  grep "validate:deploy" package.json
  # Should find: "validate:deploy": "node scripts/validate-deploy.mjs"
  ```

---

## ✅ Configuration Files

- [ ] `.env.local.example` - Safe template created
  ```bash
  ls -la .env.local.example
  # Should exist
  grep "FTP_REMOTE_DIR=/public_html/primeos" .env.local.example
  # Should find the safe path
  ```

- [ ] `.env.local` - Set up with your credentials
  ```bash
  ls -la .env.local
  # Should exist (NOT in git)
  grep "FTP_USERNAME" .env.local
  # Should have your username
  ```

- [ ] `.gitignore` - Protects .env.local from git
  ```bash
  grep ".env.local" .gitignore
  # Should find: .env.local
  ```

---

## ✅ Documentation

- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md` - Complete safety guide created
  ```bash
  ls -la DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md
  # Should exist
  head -20 DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md
  # Should show deployment guide
  ```

- [ ] `INCIDENT_RECOVERY.md` - Post-incident recovery summary
  ```bash
  ls -la INCIDENT_RECOVERY.md
  # Should exist
  ```

- [ ] `QUICK_SETUP.md` - Quick start guide
  ```bash
  ls -la QUICK_SETUP.md
  # Should exist
  ```

---

## ✅ Git Status

- [ ] Changes are staged (ready to commit)
  ```bash
  git status
  # Should show modified files
  ```

- [ ] No secrets in staging area
  ```bash
  git diff --cached | grep "PASSWORD\|TOKEN\|KEY"
  # Should NOT find any secrets
  ```

- [ ] All critical files are tracked
  ```bash
  git ls-files | grep -E "FtpDeploy|validate-deploy|DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY"
  # Should show: scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs, scripts/validate-deploy.mjs, etc.
  ```

---

## ✅ Validation Tests

- [ ] Run validation script (should fail due to missing credentials)
  ```bash
  npm run validate:deploy
  # Expected: Some checks fail because .env.local needs credentials
  # ❌ FTP_USERNAME missing
  # ❌ FTP_PASSWORD missing
  # ✅ Other checks pass
  ```

- [ ] Configuration syntax is correct
  ```bash
  node -c scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs
  # Should succeed (no syntax errors)
  node -c scripts/validate-deploy.mjs
  # Should succeed
  ```

- [ ] Git hooks are executable
  ```bash
  ls -la .husky/pre-commit
  # Should show 'x' in permissions (executable)
  # If not: chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
  ```

---

## ✅ Dangerous Configs are Blocked

Try these tests to verify protections:

### Test 1: Block /public_html as remoteRoot
```bash
# Edit scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs temporarily
# Change: remoteRoot: "/public_html/primeos"
# To:     remoteRoot: "/public_html"

# Try to commit:
git add scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs
git commit -m "test dangerous config"

# Expected: BLOCKED by pre-commit hook
# ❌ BLOCKED: Attempting to commit /public_html as remoteRoot
```

**Restore the file**:
```bash
git checkout -- scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs
```

### Test 2: Block deleteRemote: true
```bash
# Edit scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs temporarily
# Change: deleteRemote: deleteRemote,
# To:     deleteRemote: true,

# Try to commit:
git add scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs
git commit -m "test delete remote"

# Expected: BLOCKED by pre-commit hook
# ❌ BLOCKED: Attempting to commit deleteRemote: true
```

**Restore the file**:
```bash
git checkout -- scripts/FtpDeploy.mjs
```

### Test 3: Script validation during deploy
```bash
# This validates when you run:
npm run deploy:hostinger

# The script will check:
✅ DANGEROUS_ROOTS are blocked
✅ deleteRemote is false
✅ .env.local exists
✅ ./dist exists
```

---

## ✅ Team Communication

- [ ] Team is aware of the incident
- [ ] Team has read: [INCIDENT_RECOVERY.md](./INCIDENT_RECOVERY.md)
- [ ] Team knows the safe deployment process
- [ ] Team understands they must set up .env.local

---

## ✅ Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Hostinger backups are enabled
  ```bash
  # Go to: Hostinger Control Panel → File Manager → Backups
  # Verify: Daily backups available
  ```

- [ ] Know how to restore from backup
  ```bash
  # See: DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md - "Backup Best Practices"
  ```

- [ ] Have emergency contact info
  ```bash
  # Hostinger Support: contact@hostinger.com
  # See: DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md - "Emergency Contacts"
  ```
